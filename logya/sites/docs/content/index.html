<p>Logya is a command line tool to generate static Web sites, designed to be easy to use and flexible.
<p>You may ask why another static site generator, when there are so many others? Valid question, simple answer: all the others are doing it wrong. No, seriously, tools like <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, <a href="http://ringce.com/hyde">Hyde</a> or <a href="http://mynt.mirroredwhite.com/">mynt</a> are very powerful and probably provide more features out of the box than Logya ever will.</p>
<p>Two key differences comparing Logya with the above tools are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content is marked up with HTML <strong>not</strong> with markdown, reStructuredText, etc.</li>
<li>More flexible site URL structure: the url for each document must be specified in the document header and is independent of the file's location within the content directory. This way you can freely structure your content and choose your preferred style of URLs, e.g. <code>example.com/path/doc/</code> or <code>example.com/path/doc.html</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create responsive static Web sites</li>
<li>Full control over layout and design with easy-to-use templates</li>
<li>Free choice of front-end libraries like jQuery, Twitter bootstrap, or HTML5 boilerplate</li>
<li>Built-in Web server with info level logging for immediate editing feedback in the browser</li>
<li>Use your favorite editor to create content</li>
<li>Manage, deploy and backup the site with the tools you know, e.g. tar, rsync, git, mercurial, subversion</li>
<li>Commands for site creation, generation, and serving</li>
<li>Automatic generation of document indexes in created directories</li>
<li>Site configuration</li>
<li>No server side scripting security issues</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://python.org/">Python 2.7</a></li>
<li><a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs">Jinja2</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pyyaml.org/">PyYAML</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Logya is an open source Python application that can be <a href="https://github.com/yaph/logya/downloads">downloaded from</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yaph/logya">forked on Github</a>. To install it with pip run:</p>
<pre>sudo pip install logya</pre>

<p>If you downloaded the source files, you can install Logya from the project's root directory with the following command:</p>
<pre>sudo python setup.py install</pre>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>Create a starter site:</h3>
<pre>logya create mysite</pre>
<p>This command will create a new sub directory in your current working directory called mysite, that includes the resources for a logya starter site.</p>

<h3>Change to the starter site directory:</h3>
<pre>cd mysite</pre>

<h3>Generate files to deploy:</h3>
<pre>logya generate</pre>
<p>This command generates HTML files from the documents found in the content directory, indexes for Web site directories, and copies static resources to the newly created deploy directory.</p>

<h3>Serve site from deploy directory:</h3>
<pre>logya serve</pre>
<p>Run this command in the root directory of your mysite project and it will serve the static files from the deploy directory. When you edit files in your projects source directory and reload them in the browser they will be updated, so this can be used for live editing your site and see changes immediately.</p>

<h3>Get help on logya command:</h3>
<pre>logya -h</pre>
<p>Show the help output of the logya command with information on sub commands and options, for help on a sub command call it with the -h option, e.g. <code>logya create -h</code>.</p>

<h2>Directory Layout</h2>
<p>The following folders and files are recognized when generating a Web site with Logya.</p>
<h3>content - required</h3>
<p>The content directory contains all of the site's documents. Documents can be grouped into sub directories to keep better order and must end in the file extension <code>.html</code>.</p>
<h3>templates - required</h3>
<p>The templates directory contains all of the site's Jinja2 templates.</p>
<h3>site.cfg - required</h3>
<p>This file contains the site configuration.</p>
<h3>static - optional</h3>
<p>This static directory contains all static resources like JavaScript, CSS, image, and server configuration files.</p>

<h2>Document Structure</h2>
<p>Documents are basically html files containing the content of a page with header information to specify title, url, description, scripts and style sheets to include and self defined variables that can be accessed in templates.</p>

&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;<br/>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
<p>The header is in <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a> format. It starts and ends with 3 dashes. The remaining part of the document is treated as the content that goes in the body of the created HTML page. This content can be marked up with any HTML tags that can be in the body of an HTML document.</p>
<h3>Document Header</h3>
<p>Each document must specify the <code>url</code> attribute in the header, all other attributes are optional. Attribute values can range from simple strings to nested data structures that are automatically available in templates.</p>
<p>The only exception with a pre-defined value format is the <code>created</code> attribute. If you set it, it must adhere to the format <code>YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS</code> without surrounding quotes as shown in the example above. If you don't set the creation time in a document header, the file modification time will be used for sorting documents in indexes.</p>
<h2>Configuration Settings</h2>
<p>Below you find configuration sections and settings:</p>

<h3>[site] section</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>base_path</dt>
    <dd>If set will be available in all templates as base_path variable.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>[templates] section</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>index</dt>
    <dd>The template to use for generated index.html files. If not set, indexes won't be created.</dd>
  <dt>doc</dt>
    <dd>The template to use for generated content documents. If not set, the document won't be created.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>[extensions] section</h3>
<p>Currently this section is not supported. I consider using it for turning extensions on and off.</p>
<h2>Development Tips</h2>
<p>The following tips are intended for people developing logya application code.</p>
<h3>Create a command that points to the development source:</h3>
<pre>ln -s $HOME/code/logya/logya/main.py $HOME/bin/logyadev</pre>
<p>This creates a symbolic link in your home bin directory to access logya commands from your development source, assuming it resides in the first directory specified above. To not override the logya command from your installation the command is called logyadev.</p>
